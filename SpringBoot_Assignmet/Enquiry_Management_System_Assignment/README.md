# Tests

Tests written using JUnit5, Harmcrest and Spring MockMvc.
Integration tests rely on entries loaded from *data.sql* script at the start of the application.
Additionally, some tests execute their own local .sql scripts.

# Setup

Clone the repository to a folder on your computer and import it in your favourite IDE as a Maven project. It uses Tomcat 9.0 as a web server so you need to set it up in your IDE as well.

### Build

Run maven command: 'mvn clean package'. This should create an executable 'jar' with all the libraries needed, including Tomcat.

# Launch 

- you should have MySQL empty database named 'enquiries' up and running on your machine. The database should be availabe on the 3306 port although you can change the default settings in the 'application.properties' file
- you also need to change XXX in the 'application.properties' file for your username/password to the database as well as the email address username/password (including spring.mail.host property - for Gmail this would be smtp.gmail.com)
- you should also change XXX in *var key = "&key=XXX"* in *scr/main/resources/static/js/form.js* script file for your own Google Maps Javascript API v.3 key
- then, after successful build process navigate to the 'target/' folder of the project and run 'java -jar enquiries.jar' command. 
The application should be available at localhost://8080 in your Internet browser
- in windows instead of command line you should also be able to double click the 'enquiries.jar' file although you will not get any information about start-up process and its possible failure. You can check in Task Manager if process is running (JVM process).
